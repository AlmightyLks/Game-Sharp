# Game-Sharp
## A game engine built in CSharp

## About Game-Sharp
While, it is a game engine in CSharp, its very very VERY buggy, and the whole thing is kinda eh.  
This was just made to test if it works, I might work on getting it better later.

## Main goal
To create a player moving on the screen in a **__Winforms__** application.

## Binarys
None, just build it with VS lol.

## Credits
- KadeDev (Created the whole thing)
